## Bio

I am an Assistant Professor with [Center for Security, Theory and Algorithmic Research (CSTAR)](https://cstar-iiit.github.io) at [International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad (IIIT Hyderabad)](https://www.iiit.ac.in).

My research broadly lies at the interface of Algorithms, [Computational Complexity Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_theory) and [Coding Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_correction_code).

Previously, I was a post-doctoral fellow at [University of Haifa](https://haifa.ac.il/index.php/en) mentored by [Noga Ron-Zewi](https://cs.haifa.ac.il/~noga), and at [IIT Bombay](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in) mentored by [Nutan Limaye](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~nutan/). I got my MSc and PhD degrees in Computer Science from [Chennai Mathematical Institute (CMI)](http://www.cmi.ac.in) under the supervision of [Partha Mukhopadhyay](http://www.cmi.ac.in/~partham). I got my undergraduate degree from [IIT Kanpur](http://www.iitk.ac.in).
