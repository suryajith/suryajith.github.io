<p>We say that two given polynomials $f, g \in R[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$, over a ring $R$, are equivalent under shifts if there exists a vector $(a_1, \ldots, a_n)\in R^N$ such that $f(x_1+a_1, \ldots, x_n+a_n) = g(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$. This is a special variant of the polynomial projection problem in Algebraic Complexity Theory.</p>
<p>Grigoriev and Karpinski (FOCS 1990), Lakshman and Saunders (SIAM J. Computing, 1995), and Grigoriev and Lakshman (ISSAC 1995) studied the problem of testing polynomial equivalence of a given polynomial to any $t$-sparse polynomial, over the rational numbers, and gave exponential time algorithms. In this paper, we provide  hardness results for this problem.</p>
<p>Formally, for a ring $R$, let $\mathrm{SparseShift}_R$ be the following decision problem &ndash; Given a polynomial $P(X)$, is there a vector $\mathbf{a}$ such that $P(X+\mathbf{a})$ contains fewer monomials than $P(X)$. We show that $\mathrm{SparseShift}_R$ is at least as hard as checking if a given system of polynomial equations over $R[x_1,\ldots, x_n]$ has a solution (Hilbert&rsquo;s Nullstellensatz).</p>
<p>As a consequence of this reduction, we get the following results.</p>
<ol>
<li>$\mathrm{SparseShift}_\mathbb{Z}$ is undecidable.</li>
<li>Over the Blum-Shub-Smale model of computation $\mathrm{SparseShift}<em>\mathbb{R}$ is $NP</em>{\mathbb{R}}$-complete.</li>
</ol>
<p>We also study the gap version of the $\mathrm{SparseShift}_R$ and show the following.</p>
<ol>
<li>For all $\alpha &gt;1$, $\alpha$-gap-$\mathrm{SparseShift}_\mathbb{Z}$ is also undecidable.</li>
<li>For $R=\mathbb{F}_p, \mathbb{Q}, \mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_q$ and for all $\alpha &gt;1$, $\alpha$-gap-$\mathrm{SparseShift}_R$ is $NP$-hard.</li>
<li>Over the Blum-Shub-Smale model of computation $\alpha$-gap-$\mathrm{SparseShift}<em>\mathbb{R}$ is $NP</em>{\mathbb{R}}$-complete, for any $\alpha&gt;1$.</li>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Recently, Forbes, Kumar and Saptharishi [CCC, 2016] proved that there exists an explicit $d^{O(1)}$-variate and degree $d$ polynomial $P_{d} \in VNP$ such that if any depth four circuit $C$ of bounded formal degree $d$ which computes a polynomial of bounded individual degree $O(1)$, that is functionally equivalent to $P_d$, then $C$ must have size $2^{\Omega(\sqrt{d}\log{d})}$.</p>
<p>The motivation for their work comes from Boolean Circuit Complexity. Based on a characterization for $ACC^0$ circuits by Yao [FOCS, 1985] and Beigel and Tarui [CC, 1994], Forbes, Kumar and Saptharishi [CCC, 2016] observed that functions in $ACC^0$ can also be computed by algebraic $\Sigma\mathord{\wedge}\Sigma\Pi$ circuits (i.e., circuits of the form &ndash; sums of powers of polynomials) of $2^{\log^{O(1)}n}$ size. Thus they argued that a $2^{\omega(\log^{O(1)}{n})}$ <em>functional</em> lower bound for an explicit polynomial $Q$ against $\Sigma\mathord{\wedge}\Sigma\Pi$ circuits would imply a lower bound for the <em>corresponding Boolean function</em> of $Q$ against non-uniform $ACC^0$. In their work, they ask if their lower bound be extended to $\Sigma\mathord{\wedge}\Sigma\Pi$ circuits.</p>
<p>In this paper, for large integers $n$ and $d$ such that $\Omega(\log^2{n})\leq d\leq n^{0.01}$, we show that any $\Sigma\mathord{\wedge}\Sigma\Pi$ circuit of bounded individual degree at most $O(\frac{d}{k^2})$ that functionally computes Iterated Matrix Multiplication polynomial $IMM_{n,d}$ ($\in VP$) over ${{0,1}}^{n^2d}$ must have size $n^{\Omega(k)}$. Since Iterated Matrix Multiplication $IMM_{n,d}$ over ${0,1}^{n^2d}$ is functionally in $GapL$, improvement of the afore mentioned lower bound to hold for quasipolynomially large values of individual degree would imply a fine-grained separation of $ACC^0$ from $GapL$.</p>
<p>For the sake of completeness, we also show a syntactic size lower bound against any $\Sigma\mathord{\wedge}\Sigma\Pi$ circuit computing $IMM_{n,d}$ (for the same regime of $d$) which is tight over large fields. Like Forbes, Kumar and Saptharishi [CCC, 2016], we too prove lower bounds against circuits of bounded formal degree which functionally compute $IMM_{n,d}$, for a slightly larger range of individual degree.</p>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Kayal, Saha and Tavenas [Theory of Computing, 2018] showed that for all large enough integers $n$ and $d$ such that $d\geq \omega(\log{n})$, any syntactic depth four circuit of bounded individual degree $\delta = o(d)$ that computes the Iterated Matrix Multiplication polynomial ($IMM_{n,d}$) must have size $n^{\Omega\left(\sqrt{d/\delta}\right)}$. Unfortunately, this bound deteriorates as the value of $\delta$ increases. Further, the bound is superpolynomial only when $\delta$ is $o(d)$. It is natural to ask if the dependence on $\delta$ in the bound could be weakened. Towards this, in an earlier result [STACS, 2020], we showed that for all large enough integers $n$ and $d$ such that $d = \Theta(\log^2{n})$, any syntactic depth four circuit of bounded individual degree $\delta\leq n^{0.2}$ that computes $IMM_{n,d}$ must have size $n^{\Omega(\log{n})}$.</p>
<p>In this paper, we make further progress by proving that for all large enough integers $n$ and $d$, and absolute constants $a$ and $b$ such that $\omega(\log^2n)\leq d\leq n^{a}$, any syntactic depth four circuit of bounded individual degree $\delta\leq n^{b}$ that computes $IMM_{n,d}$ must have size $n^{\Omega(\sqrt{d})}$. Our bound is obtained by carefully adapting the proof of Kumar and Saraf [SIAM J. Computing, 2017] to the complexity measure introduced in our earlier work [STACS, 2020].</p>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>In this paper, we are interested in understanding the complexity of computing multilinear polynomials using depth four circuits in which the polynomial computed at every node has a bound on the individual degree of $r \geq 1$ with respect to all its variables (referred to as multi-$r$-c circuits). The goal of this study is to make progress towards proving superpolynomial lower bounds for general depth four circuits computing multilinear polynomials, by proving better bounds as the value of $r$ increases.</p>
<p>Recently, Kayal, Saha and Tavenas (Theory of Computing, 2018) showed that any depth four arithmetic circuit of bounded individual degree $r$ computing an explicit multilinear polynomial on $n^{O(1)}$ variables and degree $d$, must have size at least $\left(\frac{n}{r^{1.1}}\right)^{\Omega\left(\sqrt{\frac{d}{r}}\right)}$. This bound however deteriorates as the value of $r$ increases. It is a natural question to ask if we can prove a bound that does not deteriorate as the value of $r$ increases, or a bound that holds for a <em>larger</em> regime of $r$.</p>
<p>In this paper, we prove a lower bound which does not deteriorate with increasing values of $r$, albeit for a specific instance of $d = d(n)$ but for a <em>wider</em> range of $r$. Formally, for all large enough integers $n$ and a small constant $\eta$, we show that there exists an explicit polynomial on $n^{O(1)}$ variables and degree $\Theta(\log^2 n)$ such that any depth four circuit of bounded individual degree $r\leq n^{\eta}$  must have size at least $\exp\left(\Omega\left(\log^2 n\right)\right)$. This <em>improvement</em> is obtained by suitably adapting the complexity measure of Kayal et al. (Theory of Computing, 2018). This adaptation of the measure is inspired by the complexity measure used by Kayal et al. (SIAM J. Computing, 2017).</p>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Kayal, Saha and Tavenas (Theory of Computing, 2018), showed that any bounded-depth homogeneous formula of bounded individual degree (bounded by $r$) that computes an explicit polynomial over $n$ variables must have size $\exp\left(\Omega\left(\frac{1}{r}\left(\frac{n}{4}\right)^{1/\Delta}\right)\right)$ for all depths $\Delta \leq O\left({\frac{\log n}{\log r+ \log\log n}}\right)$. In this article we show an improved size lower bound of $\exp\left(\Omega\left(\frac{\Delta}{r}\left({\frac{nr}{2}}\right)^{1/\Delta}\right)\right)$ for all depths $\Delta \leq O\left({\frac{\log n}{\log r}}\right)$, and for the same explicit polynomial.</p>
<p>In comparison to Kayal, Saha and Tavenas (Theory of Computing, 2018)</p>
<ol>
<li>our results give superpolynomial lower bounds in a wider regime of depth $\Delta$, and</li>
<li>for all $\Delta \in \left[\omega(1), o\left(\frac{\log n}{\log r}\right)\right]$ our lower bound is asymptotically better.</li>
</ol>
<p>This improvement is due to a finer product decomposition of general homogeneous formulas of bounded-depth. This follows from an adaptation of a new \emph{product decomposition} for bounded-depth multilinear formulas shown by Chillara, Limaye and Srinivasan (SIAM Journal of Computing, 2019).</p>

<p>We study the size blow-up that is necessary to convert an algebraic circuit of product-depth $\Delta+1$ to one of product-depth $\Delta$ in the multilinear setting.</p>
<p>We show that for every positive $\Delta = \Delta(n) = o(\log n/\log \log n)$, there is an explicit multilinear polynomial $P^{(\Delta)}$ on $n$ variables that can be computed by a multilinear formula of product-depth $\Delta+1$ and size $O(n)$, but not by any multilinear circuit of product-depth $\Delta$ and size less than $\exp(n^{\Omega(1/\Delta)})$. This result is tight up to the constant implicit in the double exponent for all $\Delta = o(\log n/\log \log n)$.</p>
<p>This strengthens a result of Raz and Yehudayoff (Computational Complexity 2009) who prove a quasipolynomial separation for constant-depth multilinear circuits, and a result of Kayal, Nair and Saha (STACS 2016) who give an exponential separation in the case $\Delta = 1$.</p>
<p>Our separating examples may be viewed as algebraic analogues of variants of the Graph Reachability problem studied by Chen, Oliveira, Servedio and Tan (STOC 2016), who used them to prove lower bounds for constant-depth <em>Boolean</em> circuits.</p>

<p>We show explicit separations between the expressive powers of multilinear formulas of small-depth and all polynomial sizes.</p>
<p>Formally, for any $s = s(n) = n^{O(1)}$ and any $\delta&gt;0$, we construct explicit families of multilinear polynomials $P_n\in\mathbb{F}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ that have multilinear formulas of size $s$ and depth three but no multilinear formulas of size $s^{1/2-\delta}$ and depth $o(\log n/\log \log n).$</p>
<p>As far as we know, this is the first such result for an algebraic model of computation.</p>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>The complexity of Iterated Matrix Multiplication is a central theme in Computational Complexity theory, as the problem is closely related to the problem of separating various complexity classes within $\mathrm{P}$. In this paper, we study the algebraic formula complexity of multiplying $d$ many $2\times 2$ matrices, denoted  $IMM_{d}$, and show that the well-known divide-and-conquer algorithm cannot be significantly improved at any depth, as long as the formulas are multilinear.</p>
<p>Formally, for each depth $\Delta \leq \log d$, we show that any product-depth $\Delta$ multilinear formula for $IMM_d$ must have size $\exp(\Omega(\Delta d^{1/\Delta})).$ It also follows from this that any multilinear circuit of product-depth $\Delta$ for the same polynomial of the above form must have a size of $\exp(\Omega(d^{1/\Delta})).$ In particular, any polynomial-sized multilinear formula for $IMM_d$ must have depth $\Omega(\log d)$, and any polynomial-sized multilinear circuit for $IMM_d$ must have depth $\Omega(\log d/\log \log d).$ Both these bounds are tight up to constant factors.</p>
<p>Our lower bound has the following consequences for multilinear formula complexity.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Depth-reduction:</strong> A well-known result of Brent (JACM 1974) implies that any formula of size $s$ can be converted to one of size $s^{O(1)}$ and depth $O(\log s)$; further, this reduction continues to hold for multilinear formulas. On the other hand, our lower bound implies that any depth-reduction in the multilinear setting cannot reduce the depth to $o(\log s)$ without a superpolynomial blow-up in size.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Circuits vs. formulas:</strong> Any circuit of size $s$ and product-depth $\Delta$ can be converted into a formula of product-depth $\Delta$ and size $s^{O(\Delta)}$. In the multilinear setting, we show that it is not possible to improve on this significantly for small depths. Formally, our results imply that for all large enough $s$ and $\Delta = o(\log s/\log \log s)$, there is an explicit multilinear polynomial $P_{s,\Delta}$ that has a syntactic multilinear circuit of size $s$ and is such that any multilinear formula of product-depth $\Delta$ computing $P_{s,\Delta}$ must have size $s^{\Omega(\Delta)}$.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Separations from general formulas:</strong> Shpilka and Yehudayoff (FnTTCS 2010) asked whether general formulas can be more efficient than multilinear formulas for computing multilinear polynomials. Our result, along with a non-trivial upper bound for $IMM_{d}$ implied by a result of Gupta, Kamath, Kayal and Saptharishi (SICOMP 2016), shows that for any size $s$ and product-depth $\Delta = o(\log s),$ general formulas of size $s$ and product-depth $\Delta$ cannot be converted to multilinear formulas of size $s^{O(1)}$ and product-depth $\Delta,$ when the underlying field has characteristic zero.</p>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Depth five powering circuits are arithmetic circuits of the form $\Sigma\wedge\Sigma\wedge\Sigma$ where $\Sigma$ and $\wedge$ represent gates that compute sum and power of their inputs respectively. Such circuits compute polynomials of the form $\sum_{i=1}^t Q_i^{\alpha_{i}}$, where each $Q_i$ is a sum of powers of linear polynomials. These circuits are a natural generalization of the well known class of depth three powering circuits ($\Sigma\wedge\Sigma$ circuits). In this paper, we study the complexity of some restricted classes of depth five powering circuits that compute the monomial $x_1x_2\cdots x_n$. The restrictions we study are on the fan-ins of the $\Sigma$ and $\wedge$ gates (denoted by $\Sigma^{[a]}$ and $\wedge^{[d]}$) while the bottom $\Sigma$ gates compute homogeneous linear polynomials.</p>
<p>We prove size lower bound of $2^{\Omega(n)}$ against the following classes of depth five powering circuits that compute the monomial $x_1x_2\cdots x_n$.</p>
<ul>
<li>The $\Sigma\wedge\Sigma^{[m]}\wedge^{[\ge d]}\Sigma_{\text{Hom}}$ circuits where $d\geq 8$ and $m&lt; \frac{0.29n}{d^2}2^{0.955d}$.</li>
<li>The $\Sigma\wedge\Sigma^{{r}}\wedge^{[= d]}\Sigma_{\text{Hom}}$ circuits where $r &lt; \epsilon\cdot d$ is the rank of the linear forms under that sum gate, $\epsilon &gt;0$ is a constant and $d\geq 8$.</li>
</ul>
<p>From this, we infer that the monomial can be computed by a $\Sigma\wedge\Sigma^{[=2^{\sqrt{n}}]}\wedge^{[=\sqrt{n}]}\Sigma_{\text{Hom}}$ (or a $\Sigma\wedge\Sigma^{{=\sqrt{n}}}\wedge^{[=\sqrt{n}]}\Sigma_{\text{Hom}}$) circuit of size $2^{O(\sqrt{n})}$ but any $\Sigma\wedge\Sigma^{[\leq 2^{0.955\sqrt{n}}]}\wedge^{[\ge \sqrt{n}]}\Sigma_{\text{Hom}}$ (or a $\Sigma\wedge\Sigma^{{\leq \epsilon\sqrt{n}}}\wedge^{[= \sqrt{n}]}\Sigma_{\text{Hom}}$) circuit computing it must be of size $2^{\Omega(n)}$.</p>
<p>Our results show how the fan-in of the middle $\Sigma$ gates, the degree of the bottom powering gates and the homogeneity at the bottom $\Sigma$ gates play a crucial role in the computational power of $\Sigma\wedge\Sigma\wedge\Sigma$ circuits.</p>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Agrawal and Vinay (2008) showed how any polynomial size arithmetic circuit can be thought of as a depth four arithmetic circuit of subexponential size. This unexpected depth reduction to constant depth is in contrast to circuits in the Boolean setting.
The resulting circuit size in this simulation was more carefully analyzed by Korian (2011) and subsequently by Tavenas (2013).
We provide a simple proof of this chain of results. We then abstract the main ingredient to apply it to formulas and constant depth circuits, and show more structured depth reductions for them.</p>
<p>In an apriori surprising result, Raz (2010) showed that for any $n$ and $d$, such that $ \omega(1) \leq d \leq  O\left(\frac{\log n}{\log\log n}\right)$, constructing explicit tensors $T:[n]^d \rightarrow \mathbb{F}$ of high enough rank would imply superpolynomial lower bounds for arithmetic formulas over the field $\mathbb{F}$. Using the additional structure we obtain from our proof of the depth reduction for arithmetic formulas, we give a new and arguably simpler proof of this connection. We also extend this result for homogeneous formulas to show that, in fact, the connection holds for any $d$ such that $\omega(1) \leq d \leq n^{o(1)}$.</p>

<p>In a surprising recent result, Gupta-Kamath-Kayal-Saptharishi have proved that over $\mathbb{Q}$ any $n^{O(1)}$-variate and $n$-degree polynomial in $VP$ can also be computed by  a depth three $\Sigma\Pi\Sigma$ circuit of size $2^{O(\sqrt{n} \log^{3/2}n)}$.  Over fixed-size finite fields, Grigoriev and Karpinski proved that any $\Sigma\Pi\Sigma$ circuit that computes the determinant (or the permanent) polynomial of a $n\times n$ matrix must be of size $2^{\Omega(n)}$. In this paper, for an explicit  polynomial in $VP$ (over fixed-size finite fields), we prove that any $\Sigma\Pi\Sigma$ circuit  computing it must be of size $2^{\Omega(n\log n)}$. The explicit polynomial that we consider is the iterated matrix multiplication polynomial of $n$ generic matrices of size $n\times n$.  The importance of this result is that over fixed-size fields there is no depth reduction technique that can be used to compute all the $n^{O(1)}$-variate and $n$-degree polynomials in $VP$  by depth 3 circuits of size
$2^{o(n\log n)}$.
The result of Grigoriev and Karpinski can only rule out such a possibility for $\Sigma\Pi\Sigma$ circuits of size $2^{o(n)}$.</p>
<p>We also give an example of an explicit polynomial ($NW_{n,\epsilon}(X)$) in $VNP$ (which is not known to be in $VP$), for which any $\Sigma\Pi\Sigma$ circuit computing it (over fixed-size fields) must be of  size $2^{\Omega(n\log n)}$. The polynomial we consider is constructed from the combinatorial design of Nisan and Wigderson, and is closely related to the polynomials  considered in many recent papers (by Kayal-Saha-Saptharishi, Kayal-Limaye-Saha-Srinivasan, and Kumar-Saraf),  where strong depth 4 circuit size lower bounds are shown.</p>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>Tavenas has recently proved that any $n^{O(1)}$-variate and degree $n$ polynomial in $VP$ can be computed by a depth 4 $\Sigma\Pi\Sigma\Pi$ circuit of size $2^{O(\sqrt{n}\log n)}$ (see Tavenas (2013)). So, to prove $VP\neq VNP$ it is sufficient to show that an explicit polynomial in $VNP$ of degree $n$ requires $2^{\omega(\sqrt{n}\log n)}$ size depth 4 circuits. Soon after Tavenas' result, for two different explicit polynomials, depth 4 circuit size lower bounds of $2^{\Omega(\sqrt{n}\log n)}$ have been proved (see Kayal-Saha-Saptharishi (2013) and Fournier-Limaye-Malod-Srinivasan (2013)). In particular, using combinatorial design Kayal et al. construct an explicit polynomial in $VNP$ that requires depth 4 circuits of size $2^{\Omega(\sqrt{n}\log n)}$ and Fournier et al. show that the iterated matrix multiplication polynomial (which is in $VP$) also requires $2^{\Omega(\sqrt{n}\log n)}$ size depth 4 circuits.</p>
<p>In this paper, we identify a simple combinatorial property such that any polynomial $f$ that satisfies this property would achieve a similar depth 4 circuit size lower bound. In particular, it does not matter whether $f$ is in $VP$ or in $VNP$. As a result, we get a simple unified lower bound analysis for the above mentioned polynomials.</p>
<p>Another goal of this paper is to compare our current knowledge of the depth 4 circuit size lower bounds and the determinantal complexity lower bounds. Currently the best known determinantal complexity lower bound is $\Omega(n^2)$ for Permanent of a $n\times n$ matrix (which is a $n^2$-variate and degree $n$ polynomial) (due to Cai, Chen and Li (2008)). We prove that the determinantal complexity of the iterated matrix multiplication polynomial is $\Omega(dn)$ where $d$ is the number of matrices and $n$ is the dimension of the matrices. So for $d=n$, we get that the iterated matrix multiplication polynomial achieves the current best known lower bounds in both fronts: depth 4 circuit size and determinantal complexity. Our result also settles the determinantal complexity of the iterated matrix multiplication polynomial to $\Theta(dn)$.</p>
<p>To the best of our knowledge, a $\Theta(n)$ bound for the determinantal complexity for the iterated matrix multiplication polynomial was known only for  any constant $d&gt;1$ (cf. Jansen (2011)).</p>
