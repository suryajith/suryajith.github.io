Publisher Information  Manuscript  Abstract We say that two given polynomials $f, g \in R[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$, over a ring $R$, are equivalent under shifts if there exists a vector $(a_1, \ldots, a_n)\in R^N$ such that $f(x_1+a_1, \ldots, x_n+a_n) = g(x_1, \ldots, x_n)$. This is a special variant of the polynomial projection problem in Algebraic Complexity Theory.</description>

Publisher Information  Conference: FSTTCS 2021, Pages 14:1-14:15 (LIPIcs, Vol 213)  Abstract Recently, Forbes, Kumar and Saptharishi [CCC, 2016] proved that there exists an explicit $d^{O(1)}$-variate and degree $d$ polynomial $P_{d} \in VNP$ such that if any depth four circuit $C$ of bounded formal degree $d$ which computes a polynomial of bounded individual degree $O(1)$, that is functionally equivalent to $P_d$, then $C$ must have size $2^{\Omega(\sqrt{d}\log{d})}$.</description>

Publisher Information  Preprint: Electron. Colloquium Comput. Complex. 27: 33 (2020)  Abstract Kayal, Saha and Tavenas [Theory of Computing, 2018] showed that for all large enough integers $n$ and $d$ such that $d\geq \omega(\log{n})$, any syntactic depth four circuit of bounded individual degree $\delta = o(d)$ that computes the Iterated Matrix Multiplication polynomial ($IMM_{n,d}$) must have size $n^{\Omega\left(\sqrt{d/\delta}\right)}$. Unfortunately, this bound deteriorates as the value of $\delta$ increases.</description>

Publisher Information  Journal: Information Processing Letters, vol 156  Abstract Kayal, Saha and Tavenas (Theory of Computing, 2018), showed that any bounded-depth homogeneous formula of bounded individual degree (bounded by $r$) that computes an explicit polynomial over $n$ variables must have size $\exp\left(\Omega\left(\frac{1}{r}\left(\frac{n}{4}\right)^{1/\Delta}\right)\right)$ for all depths $\Delta \leq O\left({\frac{\log n}{\log r+ \log\log n}}\right)$. In this article we show an improved size lower bound of $\exp\left(\Omega\left(\frac{\Delta}{r}\left({\frac{nr}{2}}\right)^{1/\Delta}\right)\right)$ for all depths $\Delta \leq O\left({\frac{\log n}{\log r}}\right)$, and for the same explicit polynomial.</description>

Publisher Information  Conference: FOCS 2018, Pages 934-945  Abstract We study the size blow-up that is necessary to convert an algebraic circuit of product-depth $\Delta+1$ to one of product-depth $\Delta$ in the multilinear setting.
We show that for every positive $\Delta = \Delta(n) = o(\log n/\log \log n)$, there is an explicit multilinear polynomial $P^{(\Delta)}$ on $n$ variables that can be computed by a multilinear formula of product-depth $\Delta+1$ and size $O(n)$, but not by any multilinear circuit of product-depth $\Delta$ and size less than $\exp(n^{\Omega(1/\Delta)})$.</description>

Publisher Information  Conference: ICALP 2018, Pages 36:1-36:13 (LIPIcs, Vol. 107)  Abstract We show explicit separations between the expressive powers of multilinear formulas of small-depth and all polynomial sizes.
Formally, for any $s = s(n) = n^{O(1)}$ and any $\delta&amp;gt;0$, we construct explicit families of multilinear polynomials $P_n\in\mathbb{F}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ that have multilinear formulas of size $s$ and depth three but no multilinear formulas of size $s^{1/2-\delta}$ and depth $o(\log n/\log \log n).</description>

Publisher Information  Journal: SIAM Journal of Computing. 48(1): 70-92, 2019 Conference: STACS 2018, Pages 21:1-21:15  Abstract The complexity of Iterated Matrix Multiplication is a central theme in Computational Complexity theory, as the problem is closely related to the problem of separating various complexity classes within $\mathrm{P}$. In this paper, we study the algebraic formula complexity of multiplying $d$ many $2\times 2$ matrices, denoted $IMM_{d}$, and show that the well-known divide-and-conquer algorithm cannot be significantly improved at any depth, as long as the formulas are multilinear.</description>

Publisher Information  Journal: Chicago Journal of Theoretical Computer Science (accepted)  Abstract Depth five powering circuits are arithmetic circuits of the form $\Sigma\wedge\Sigma\wedge\Sigma$ where $\Sigma$ and $\wedge$ represent gates that compute sum and power of their inputs respectively. Such circuits compute polynomials of the form $\sum_{i=1}^t Q_i^{\alpha_{i}}$, where each $Q_i$ is a sum of powers of linear polynomials.</description>

Publisher Information  Preprint: Electron. Colloquium Comput. Complex. 23: 96 (2016)  Abstract Agrawal and Vinay (2008) showed how any polynomial size arithmetic circuit can be thought of as a depth four arithmetic circuit of subexponential size. This unexpected depth reduction to constant depth is in contrast to circuits in the Boolean setting. The resulting circuit size in this simulation was more carefully analyzed by Korian (2011) and subsequently by Tavenas (2013).</description>

Publisher Information  Journal: Information and Computation, Vol 256, Pages 35-44 Conference: MFCS 2014, Vol 2, Pages 177-188  Abstract In a surprising recent result, Gupta-Kamath-Kayal-Saptharishi have proved that over $\mathbb{Q}$ any $n^{O(1)}$-variate and $n$-degree polynomial in $VP$ can also be computed by a depth three $\Sigma\Pi\Sigma$ circuit of size $2^{O(\sqrt{n} \log^{3/2}n)}$. Over fixed-size finite fields, Grigoriev and Karpinski proved that any $\Sigma\Pi\Sigma$ circuit that computes the determinant (or the permanent) polynomial of a $n\times n$ matrix must be of size $2^{\Omega(n)}$.</description>

Publisher Information  Journal: Computational Complexity 28, pages 545–572 (2019) Conference: STACS 2014, Pages 239-250 (LIPIcs, Vol. 25)  Abstract Tavenas has recently proved that any $n^{O(1)}$-variate and degree $n$ polynomial in $VP$ can be computed by a depth 4 $\Sigma\Pi\Sigma\Pi$ circuit of size $2^{O(\sqrt{n}\log n)}$ (see Tavenas (2013)). So, to prove $VP\neq VNP$ it is sufficient to show that an explicit polynomial in $VNP$ of degree $n$ requires $2^{\omega(\sqrt{n}\log n)}$ size depth 4 circuits.</description>
